# tcin_alert_bot
The bot was developed for TCIN for the purpose of tracking website page status of a brand they are keenly waiting for. 

The script has been wholly written in **Python**.
The script uses **Telegram API** for pushing messages to selected members of the group privately. It utilises the '**request**' library of python for website related functions.

Note: Some extra files required for deployment has been hidden to hide critical server structure info.
